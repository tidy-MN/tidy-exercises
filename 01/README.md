# 01 - Table Mismatch

Your team has been sharing a **penguin** data set for years with the precise format and column names seen in `correct_format.csv`

You've just been sent a new file (`new_file.csv`) from a collaborator. Unfortunately it doesn't match the requirements.

<br>

## Goal

- **Clone** [this repository](https://github.com/tidy-MN/weekly-exercise) or download the two files at https://github.com/tidy-MN/weekly-exercise/01. 

- Change the column names in `new_file.csv` to match the column names in `correct_format.csv`. 

- Save the file as `01_new_file_formatted.csv`.


## Bonus

Combine the two tables `correct_format` and `01_new_file_formatted` and save the combined dataframe as `02_combined_data.csv`.
