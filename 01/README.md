# 01 - Table Mismatch :penguin:

<br>

> Your research team in Antartica has been sharing a **penguin** data set for years with the exact format and column names found in `correct_format.csv`.
>
> You've just been sent a new file named `new_file.csv` from a collaborator. Unfortunately it doesn't match your formatting requirements. Follow the steps below to get the data into the required format and keep that penguin data **up-to-date**.

<br>

## Goal

- Create a new project and **Clone** [this repository](https://github.com/tidy-MN/weekly-exercise) by clicking the green <kbd>**<> Code**</kbd> button and copying the HTTPS link
    - Or skip that and download the two CSV files at https://github.com/tidy-MN/weekly-exercise/01. 

- Create a new R script named `table_mismatch_YOUR_INITIALS.R`

- Change the column names in `new_file.csv` to match the column names in `correct_format.csv`. 

- Save the updated file to a CSV named `01_new_file_formatted.csv`

- Save your script to the `solutions/` folder

- If you cloned the repository, use the `Git` tab in RStudio to **Commit** and **Push** your saved R script back to GitHub

<br>

## Bonus

Combine the two tables `correct_format` and `01_new_file_formatted` and save the combined dataframe as `02_combined_data.csv`.
